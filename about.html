		<p> From James Beard Nominated Best Chefs: Southeast Andy Ticer and Michael Hudman, Catherine & Mary's has opened in the newly renovated Chisca Apartments. Located on the coner of S. Main Street and MLK Dr., Catherine & Mary's brings the heart of Tuscan and Sicilian Grandmother cooking to Downtown Memphis. From an expensive wine list and crafted and curated cocktail list to our menu of traditional and new riffs, the restaurant strives to create an experience for our guests that at once reminds them of home and delievers a sense of something new. </p>
